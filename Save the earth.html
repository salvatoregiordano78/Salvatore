:: 1 {"position":"1225,650","size":"100,100"}
Perfect! You saved the earth and you earn an additional 10 points.
Congratulations!


:: 1. ax^2+bx+c=0 {"position":"700,275","size":"100,100"}
The equation is correct, so you earned your first 10 points.
Now scientist need to identify the x-intercepts of the parabolic path.
Please, click on the correct x-intercepts:
[[x=-5,x=-3]]
[[x=5,x=-3]]


:: 2. y=ax+b {"position":"700,125","size":"100,100"}
Your answer is incorrect, so please, try again by clicking on [[this link]].
Unfortunately you loose 5 points.


:: 3 {"position":"1250,325","size":"100,100"}
Unfortunately your answer is incorrect and you lose 5 points.
Please try again by clicking on the equation [[y=a(x-5)(x+3)]] 


:: 5 {"position":"1275,475","size":"100,100"}
Unfortunately your answer is incorrect and you lose 5 points.
Please try again by clicking on the equation [[y=a(x-5)(x+3)]] 


:: Story {"position":"175,200","size":"100,100"}
An asteroid is threatening earth and scientists had to prepare some nuclear weapons to make sure it is destroyed before hitting earth.

The weapon needs to be launched in a precise parabolic path. This is the only chance we have to survive.
Please, click [[here]] to start the game.
In order to be successful on this game you will have to earn at least 30 points.

Scientists are given three points coordinates with respect to a specific system of coordinates.
The points are (5,0), (-3,0) and (6,9).
First the scientist will need to identify the correct equation to use.
Click on the correct equation. If wrong , you will have to retry
[[1. ax^2+bx+c=0]]
[[2. y=ax+b]]



:: x=-5,x=-3 {"position":"875,225","size":"100,100"}
Your answer is incorrect, so you loose 5 points.
Please, retry by starting from the correct equation [[1. ax^2+bx+c=0]] 


:: x=5,x=-3 {"position":"900,375","size":"100,100"}
Great! You earned 10 points
What equation is in the correct form, given the two x-intercepts?
[[y=a(x-5)(x+3)]]
[[y=a(x+5)(x-3)]]


:: y=a(x+5)(x-3) {"position":"1125,325","size":"100,100"}
Your answer is incorrect. You lose 5 points.
Come back to the previous page by cliking on the x-intercpets' link
[[x=5,x=-3]]  and try again


:: y=a(x-5)(x+3) {"position":"1125,475","size":"100,100"}
Excellent! You earned 10 more points.
We finally need to determine the value of the coefficient a in the equation
y=a(x-5)(x+3)
Please, do the calculation based on the given third point (6,9).
Which one is the correct value for "a"?
[[5]]
[[3]]
[[1]]
